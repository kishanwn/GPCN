# Introduction

This repository contains the code and data for the Graph Polynomial Convolution Model. The basic mode is GPCN which consists of convolution by higher-order normalized adjacency matrices with higher-orders of weight matrices. This model has a variation GPCN-LINK (AGPCN) which combined the graph polynomial model with direct learning from the normalized adjacency matrix using adaptive scaling. Further, there are full-adaptive models of AGPCN and AGPCN-LINK which learns the coefficients of higher-order convolutions.
